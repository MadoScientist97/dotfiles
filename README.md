<h1> Please Readme First</h1>
<ul>
<li>These are my personal Dotfiles.<br>
<li>Inspired from people like ThePrimagen (for Nvim and tmux), Distrotube (for window managers and status bar), r/unixporn for some nice scripts, and a whole load of others on youtube.<br>
<li>These are provided with absolutely no gurantee.<br>
<li>Please try them on a VM first. These were made for a current arch build I am running and will be updated as I update and things break.<br>
<li>These may or may not work on yours exactly as there is no checking for dependencies for any scripts here.<br>
<li>I like function over looks. As of now I have more free time in my hands to tinker around and find the perfect balance and shortcuts (for me).<br>
<li>Some of the files here are direct ctrl-c, ctrl-v like using the default theme for rofi.<br>
<li>In the .xlock folder I am not putting any of the pics you may have seen on my post as I am not sure if they are copyrighted. You can put in any .png pic that you like, ofcourse if the pic have transparent background the background color would be randomly generated.<br>
<li>Personal Advice: If you are already on a job/adapted to a workflow using gui and mouse, changing to a keyboard only workflow maynot be the best line of action for you. You'll need to put in time to get more productive.<br>
</ul>
